==================== FINDINGS FROM THE SPACE LAUNCH DATA ANALYSIS ====================

The analysis reveals a *remarkable increase* in **unmanned space missions**, 
a phenomenon driven primarily by *technological advances* in the space sector.

Over the past 25 years, **research satellites** have been the *most frequently launched*, 
reflecting humanity’s growing interest in exploring space in search of *new knowledge*.

Additionally, there is a rising trend in the launch of **time-measuring satellites**, 
highlighting their *vital role* in *climate monitoring* and *forecasting* on a global scale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A significant finding is the *notable volume* of **spy satellites**, 
which raises *serious concerns* about **security** and **global surveillance** 
in the space domain.

Regarding the technology used, the **traditional rocket** remains the 
*most commonly employed method*.  
However, this does *not* imply a lack of investment in *new alternatives*.  
For instance, the **United States** has *heavily invested* in **nuclear propulsion** 
as a leading technology for its space missions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important advances is the **increased use of reusable rockets**, 
a major step forward in both *sustainability* and *efficiency* of space launches.

Yet, it's important to note that **traditional rocket technology** still produces 
*the highest levels of environmental pollution*.  
By contrast, **solar propulsion** stands out as *the cleanest and most ecological option*, 
causing *minimal impact* on the environment.

======================================================================================

In conclusion, while **space technology** is advancing rapidly, there remain 
*critical challenges* related to **sustainability** and **environmental impact**  
— challenges that demand *attention*, *responsibility*, and *innovative solutions*.
